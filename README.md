# CRUD-APIs
This is my attempt to create CRUD APIs for users.
Tech stack I used:
### Node.js
### MongoDB (mongoose)
### Redis (redis)
### Elasticsearch (elasticsearch)
### RabbitMQ (amqplib)

## start
run 
npm init  to initialize your project
npm install   to install all required dependencies
install kibana,elastic,redis,mongodb,rabbitMQ
-start services
bin/kibana   to start kibana
bin/elastic  to start elastic
brew start services redis
brew start services mongodb7.0@community 
brew start services rabbitMQ
make sure to install nodejs client for each one it is mentioned above in bracket.
